## Linux Kernel Module for Task Information
Linux Kernel Module for Task Information. (Operating System Concepts, 10th Edition, Chapter 3, Project 2)

### Description
This is a Linux kernel module that uses the `/proc` file system for diplaying a task's information based on it's process identifier value `pid`.

The whole project can be broken down into 3 steps:

1. Writing a process identifier to the file `/proc/pid`(Module Instantiation)
2. Writing to the `/proc` file system
3. Reading from the `/proc` file system

Once a `pid` has been written to the `/proc/pid` file, subsequent reads from `/proc/pid` will report

1. the command the task is running
2. the value of the taskâ€™s `pid` 
3. the current state of the task.

### Environment

- OS: Ubuntu 18.04(Kernel version: 5.4.0-131-generic)
- Compiler: GCC 7.5.0

### Procedure

First we have to make an entry to the Kernel Memory to use the /proc pseudo file system. So we start with making a single module or API which runs every time we enter 
`cat /proc/pid`.
This module contains multiple functions- proc_read, proc_write, proc_init, proc_exit.

Each function serves its own purpose. `proc_init` and `proc_exit` are used to initiate the proc file system entry in the kernel

`proc_read` is used to read the `pid` values from the kernel(i.e, command of the task, value of `pid`, and current state of the task).

`proc_write` is used to store the pid value to write to the memory for future use by allocating some space

#### Makefile Generation

For Linux Kernel to operate on the module we created, it has to be converted to a `.ko` format (kernel executable file) from a `.c` file.

For this purpose we have to generate a makefile in order to convert the `.c` module to a `.ko` file. The makefile is attached above.

#### Code and Logic

Each time the `/proc/proc_mod` file is read, the `proc_read()` function is called
repeatedly until it returns 0, so there must be logic to ensure that this function returns 0 once it has collected the data.

So the final code is attached above with the name `proc_mod.c` which includes all the codes we discussed(procread, write,init, exit)

### Output
